============

Friendstream.ca lets you view all your social network (currently support Twitter, Facebook, Google+,
Sina Weibo) real-time `happenings` in one page. You can also update your status to different social networks just in one post and share `happenings` between different social networks just in one click. This web app utilizes Twitter RESTv1.1 API, Facebook Graph API, Google+ REST API, Sina Weibo REST API and OAuth2.0 technology. The website is developed by myself using HTML,
CSS, PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, XML and JSON. URL: http://www.friendstream.ca
